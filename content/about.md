My name is **Kevin Hernández**. 

I believe in the **LORD God** through whom all things were created — _Colossians 1:16_. My aim is always to give the glory, the honor and the power due his name.

As a [**functional artist**](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2013/02/21/programming-is-an-art/#programmers-are-functional-artists), I write useful code and attempt to solve problems (with `code`) in the most elegant way.
