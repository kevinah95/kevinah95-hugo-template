      <description>My name is Kevin Hernández.
I believe in the LORD God through whom all things were created — Colossians 1:16. My aim is always to give the glory, the honor and the power due his name.
As a functional artist, I write useful code and attempt to solve problems (with code) in the most elegant way.</description>
